This page is an excerpt of answers to frequently asked questions collected from multiple sources.

If you want to participate in the discussion and make your suggestions, you can leave a message or submit an issue on the following two platforms.

- [Stacks Forum](https://forum.stacks.org/t/request-for-testing-alpha-mining-bot/11372)
- [Github](https://github.com/Daemon-Technologies)

## Where do I sign up?

Use the register button on the [competition sign-up page](https://daemontechnologies.co/minestx-challenge), and enter your name, email address, and keychain information (BTC and STX addresses).

## How do I generate a keychain?

Generating a keychain requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/) as a prerequisite, and afterward there are two packages that help create the keychain. There is also a [video outlining the process](https://youtu.be/82b8PGoQYpI) on Windows.

Generate keychain command from the [Stacks documentation](https://docs.blockstack.org/start-mining#running-a-miner):

```
npx @stacks/cli make_keychain -t > keychain.json
```

Generate keychain using [stacks-gen](https://github.com/psq/stacks-gen) from Pascal:

```
npx -q stacks-gen sk --testnet > keychain.json
```

## Do I need to run more than one miner?

No, for the competition only running one miner is needed, and the same person cannot be rewarded twice for participation. For more information, see the [official rules](https://daemontechnologies.co/stx-mining-rules).

## Which testnet is the current mining competition based on?

The current mining competition is based on the `Krypton` testnet. The tutorial given at [Blockstacks official document](https://docs.blockstack.org/start-mining)  is based on the `Xenon` testnet. If you want to know about the installation and deployment of the `Krypton` testnet, please refer to [Mining Bot Alpha version tutorial](https://daemon-technologies.github.io/docs/Mining-Bot-Alpha-Version/).

## Can I use VPS to run the Mining Bot?

No, VPS is not supported right now.

## Can I participate in mining without using Mining Bot?

of course can. Essentially, mining is based on running stacks-node after modifying the [configuration file]()(seed/burn_fee_cap/...). After you clone the [stacks-node](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain), you can create a `.toml` file(maybe `miner-conf.toml`) like the following at `stacks-blockchain/testnet/stacks-node/conf`.

**【Important】Remember to use correct version of `stacks-node` source code. Last version supported during contest is `v24.0.0.0-xenon`.**
```bash
$ git -c advice.detachedHead=false checkout tags/v24.0.0.0-xenon 
```

**【Tips】Remember to modify the seed and burn_fee_cap in the `.toml` file, where seed is your private key and burn_fee_cap is your burned bitcoin value.**

```toml
[node]
rpc_bind = "0.0.0.0:20443"
p2p_bind = "0.0.0.0:20444"
bootstrap_node = "048dd4f26101715853533dee005f0915375854fd5be73405f679c1917a5d4d16aaaf3c4c0d7a9c132a36b8c5fe1287f07dad8c910174d789eb24bdfb5ae26f5f27@krypton.blockstack.org:20444"
miner = true
seed = "Your private key"

[burnchain]
chain = "bitcoin"
mode = "krypton"
peer_host = "bitcoind.krypton.blockstack.org"
rpc_port = 18443
peer_port = 18444
burn_fee_cap = [Your burn fee]

[[mstx_balance]]
address = "STB44HYPYAT2BB2QE513NSP81HTMYWBJP02HPGK6"
amount = 10000000000000000

[[mstx_balance]]
address = "ST11NJTTKGVT6D1HY4NJRVQWMQM7TVAR091EJ8P2Y"
amount = 10000000000000000

[[mstx_balance]]
address = "ST1HB1T8WRNBYB0Y3T7WXZS38NKKPTBR3EG9EPJKR"
amount = 10000000000000000

[[mstx_balance]]
address = "STRYYQQ9M8KAF4NS7WNZQYY59X93XEKR31JP64CP"
amount = 10000000000000000
```

then, get into `stacks-blockchain/testnet/stacks-node`:

```shell
# use the command to check where you are
pwd
# make sure you are at stacks-node directory
# output looks like
# ..../stacks-blockchain/testnet/stacks-node
```

start mining(use your `.toml` file):

```shell
cargo run start --config=./conf/miner-conf.toml
```

If you see the output like the following which means you run the mining program successfully:

```shell

     Running `/home/sher/stacks-mining/stacks-blockchain/target/debug/stacks-node start --config=./conf/miner-conf.toml`

## Does Mining Bot support the Xenon testnet?

It is not currently supported, but will be supported in the near future.
